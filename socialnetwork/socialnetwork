1. First of all I added algorithm to find some intersections.
2. Tried to add mongoDB and use some aggregation functions to achieve same result - no luck.
3. Added simple architecture for rest service with spring boot. Divided to common layers: dao/service/controller.
4. Move intersection calculation to service layer.
5. Added isolation levels for transaction. READ_COMMITTED - because we want to avoid inconsistencies in app. 
6. Bug fixing.

Hope I correctly understand this task. :)
